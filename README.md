# What is this repository?
This repository contains various scripts I have developed that are able to be presented in a public fashion.

# Can you add more scripts?
These scripts are added once I am able to sanitize them and provide them for public use.

# Can I use these?
Sure, these are open for free use. However, support will be minimal.
